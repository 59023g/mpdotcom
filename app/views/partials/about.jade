      p "Michael is a quick learner and got up to speed on a complex application (Magento) right away. The goal was to increase the pagespeed of an already optimized ecommerce site, and he was able to increase average load times by ~50%. Not only did he refactor the javascript, which was the main task, he found other creative ways to increase speed and shave roughly 30% of the total page size. 
        p He was super friendly and patient to work with. He had very fast turnaround. We collaborated over GitHub, and he worked off an existing Grunt setup and he took the Grunt configurations even further to enable better, quicker, and more uniform deployments. 
        p What I really liked is that I could ramble off a ton of complex requirements, and he'd repeat back to me almost everything I needed in a very coherent fashion, showing he really understood what needed to get done. He's a go-getter, and I highly recommend him" <br> -
